Unicode character map support for IBus.

* What's this

This package contains the following components:

- ibus-ui-charmap-gtk: a D-Bus service running on IBus bus, which provides
  a character map UI
- libibuscharmap: a client library to access the service
- ibus-engine-charmap: an example IBus engine using the service

* Install

You will need:

- IBus (pkgconfig: ibus-1.0 >= 1.4.0)
- Gucharmap 3.0.* (pkgconfig: gucharmap-2.90 >= 3.0.1)
- Vala 0.12

 $ sudo yum install ibus-devel gucharmap-devel vala
 $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr # --libdir=/usr/lib64
 $ make
 $ sudo make install

* Usage

Add "Other -> Character Map" engine with ibus-setup, enable IBus on a
GTK application, and you will see a character map.  Then, double-click
a Unicode character to input it.

The IME supports keyboard-only operation.  Here is the list of key
bindings:

- Alt+Down: select chapter (Unicode block)
- Return: commit the character on the selected cell in charmap
- Up/Down: move the current cell in charmap across lines
- Left/Right: move the current cell in charmap back and forward
- Page_Up/Page_Down: move the current cell in charmap across pages
- Home/End: move to the first/end cell in charmap
- any ASCII letter: start search by Unicode name
